1. Copy 'campfire-mp3' into server file location. (with mamp:  mamp/htdocs)
2. Run 'campfire-mp3/install.php' to set up the database. 
3. Use phpMyAdmin (found on the mamp html start page) to populate the database 'songs'. This is done on the insert tab.
	a. Id can be left blank (auto filled)
	b. Mp3urls needs t o end with .mp3
	c. Selected = 0 
	d. Users should be either one, two, three, four
	e. Color:
		i. User 1 = 7EE8FA
		ii. user 2 = FFF07C
		iii. User 3 = EF767A
		iv. User 4 = 7DCE82
		v. Can be done with sql: UPDATE 'songs' SET color="7EE8FA " WHERE user='one'	

4. Songs need to be placed into a file called 'video ' 




NOTES
1. Player.php controls are currently mapped to a,w, and space
	a. A= stop	
	b. W = play 
	c. Space = skip/next page
       	This can be changed in first <script> section of campfire-mp3/public/player.php
       
2. You may want to change the songs I'm using as they were more tailored to my fam. I have about half of the original set downloaded and converted to mp3.

       I can't think of any more steps but who knows.
